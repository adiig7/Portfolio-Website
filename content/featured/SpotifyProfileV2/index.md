I built this Dapp using Solidity for writing the smart contract and HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend. The Smart Contract is deployed to the Rinkeby Test Network.

This Dapp allows a user to set his/her to the blockchain and retrive his/her recent mood from the blockchain and display it on the screen.
